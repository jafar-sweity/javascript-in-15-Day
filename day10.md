## (OOP ==>`Class & Prototypes` ) 
#### ---- ( The last topic in the second course ) ----

## lesson summary 
* An enormously popular paradigm for structuring our complex code
* The Object-oriented paradigm aims is to let us achieve these three goals :  1. Easy to reason about , 2.Easy to add features to (new functionality ) , 3.efficient and performant 
* **Dot Notation** : is useful when you know the property ahead of time.

## `In JavaScript, there are four ways to create an object` :
* Object Literals : Object literals are a comma-separated list of key-value pairs wrapped in curly braces
* Constructor Functions : The second method of creating a JavaScript object is to use the constructor function. We define an object type without any specific values. Then, we create new object instances and populate each of them with different values
* ECMAScript 6 Classes :ECMAScript 6 introduced the class keyword to create classes in JavaScript. Now we can use the class attribute to create a class in JavaScript instead of a function constructor, and use the new operator to create an instance. With the new ES6 class syntax
* Object.create Method : We can also create new objects using the Object.create() method, which allows us to use an existing object literal as the prototype of a new object we create .

### JavaScript ‚ÄúThis‚Äù Keyword :
- In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to the context in which a function is executed. It allows access to the current object or the current instance of a class. The specific value of this depends on how a function is called.
- Regular functions in JavaScript define their own this value based on the context in which they are called. The this value is determined dynamically at runtime and can vary depending on how the function is invoked. It can be influenced by the way a function is called 
- Arrow functions, on the other hand, do not bind their own this value. Instead, they lexically capture the this value of the enclosing context.
