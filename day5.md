A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


# Day 4 :
## (Data Fetching & Promises , Destructuring Data , Async ,Modules , Wrapping up) 

## lesson summary 
*  Data Fetching : The fetch() method in JavaScript is used to request data from a server. The request can be of any type of API that returns the data in JSON or XML. The fetch() method requires one parameter, the URL to request, and returns a **promise**
* promise : A JavaScript Promise object contains both the producing code and calls to the consuming code and JavaScript promises can be : **Pending** : undefined ,**Fulfilled** : a result value,**Rejected** : 	an error object 
* Destructuring Data  : is JavaScript expression that allows us to Extract vlaue form object , array , and maps and set them in distinct variables , Destructuring allows us to extract multiple properties, or items, from an arrayâ€‹ at a time.

*  Conditionals  in js is  control behavior  and determine whether or not pieces of code can run

* The keyword async before a function makes the function return a promise 
* The await keyword can only be used inside an async function , and makes the function pause the execution and wait for a resolved promise before it continues:
* modules : **What is a Module ?**
- &#8593; &#8593;  : JavaScript modules are a way to organize and structure code. They allow developers to break their code into smaller, reusable pieces. You can think about them as smaller pieces of code that you can import and export between different parts of an application.
